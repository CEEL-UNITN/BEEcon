## <span style="color:orange"> About </span> 

The **Behavioural and Experimental Economics (BEEcon) Reading Group** meets every two weeks to discuss new developments in behavioural economics and related fields in a friendly and informal environment. Meetings may involve the discussion of research papers or ongoing projects by students or faculty members.

The reading group is organised by [Austeja Kazemekaytite](mailto:a.kazemekaityte@unitn.it?subject=BEEcon%20Reading%20Group) and [Nicola Campigotto](mailto:nicola.campigotto@unitn.it?subject=BEEcon%20Reading%20Group). Reading suggestions from participants are welcome.

### Who can participate?

Anyone from students to full professors :)

### Formula

Each meeting consists of a one-hour presentation by the speaker, followed by a general discussion. Presentations are interactive and questions from participants are strongly encouraged. If a meeting involves the discussion of a research paper, each participant (and not just the speaker!) is encouraged to read the paper in advance.

### Time and place

Thursday from 4PM to 5PM, Department of Economics and Management, University of Trento, via Vigilio Inama 5, Room X (first floor)

Below is an overview of the upcoming meetings. Any changes to the normal schedule will be announced in advance.
