# About 

The **Behavioural and Experimental Economics (BEEcon) Reading Group** meets every two weeks to discuss recent developments in behavioural economics and related fields in a friendly and informal environment. Meetings may involve the discussion of research papers or ongoing projects by students or faculty members.

The 2023-24 reading group is organised by [Austeja Kazemekaytite](mailto:a.kazemekaityte@unitn.it?subject=BEEcon%20Reading%20Group) and [Nicola Campigotto](mailto:nicola.campigotto@unitn.it?subject=BEEcon%20Reading%20Group). Reading suggestions from participants are welcome.

### *Who can participate?*

Anyone from students to full professors :)

### *Formula*

Each meeting consists of a one-hour presentation by the speaker, followed by a general discussion. Presentations are interactive and questions from participants are strongly encouraged. If a meeting involves the discussion of a research paper, each participant (and not just the speaker!) is encouraged to read the paper in advance.

### *Time and venue*

**When:** Thursday from 4PM to about 5.30PM    
**Where:** Department of Economics and Management, University of Trento, via Vigilio Inama 5, Room X (first floor)

Below is an overview of the upcoming meetings. Any changes to the normal schedule will be announced in advance.
